A Machine learning scientist, a Data Scientist, an Artificial Intelligence Researcher and Volunteer with experiences in software, networks and systems admin. A PhD candidate in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) specializing in Biomedical Information Extraction at the University of Liverpool working with [Danushka Bollegala](https://danushka.net/), [Paula Williamson](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/staff/paula-williamson/) and [Susanna Dodd](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/staff/susanna-dodd/).

## Research Interests

AI is something I enjoy tinkering with, particularly making use of Natural Language Processing to simplify the way humans understand and communicate through written text. I'm keen on Few-shot & Zero-shot learning, Multi-task learning, Natural Language Generation, Non-autoregressive language generation, Entity recognition, Prompt based learning, Information retrieval, Multi-label text classification etc.
